## Project Vision

**CadentialAI** is a personal Windows AI assistant project, built on top of Microsoft's UFO² framework. It serves as an intelligent companion that understands natural language commands and automates complex desktop workflows across multiple applications. The goal is to create a truly personalized AI assistant that learns from usage patterns and becomes increasingly helpful over time.

## Architecture Overview

CadentialAI is built as a layer on top of UFO²'s **Desktop AgentOS**, incorporating:

1. **Personal Command Interface** – Natural language processing for voice and text commands with personalized vocabulary
2. **UFO² Integration Layer** – Direct integration with UFO²'s HostAgent and AppAgent systems for desktop automation
3. **Learning Engine** – Machine learning components that adapt to workflows and preferences
4. **Knowledge Management** – Personal document indexing, email integration, and contextual information retrieval
5. **Productivity Analytics** – Tracking and optimization of daily computer usage patterns
6. **Custom Skill Modules** – Specialized modules for specific workflows (development, writing, research, etc.)

Built on UFO²'s proven foundation of Windows UIA, Win32, and WinCOM integration for reliable desktop control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python >= 3.10** 
- **Windows OS >= 10**
- **UFO² Framework** (included)
- **OpenAI API Key** (for GPT-4 integration)

### Installation
```powershell
# Clone the CadentialAI repository (includes UFO framework)
git clone https://github.com/Cadential-Studios/CadentialAI.git
cd CadentialAI

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install UFO dependencies
pip install -r UFO\requirements.txt

# Setup configuration files
.\setup.ps1 -SetupConfig
```

> **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError` errors for
> `yaml`, `colorama`, `pywinauto`, or `win32api`, ensure all dependencies are
> installed using the commands above. Note that `pywin32`/`win32api` only
> installs on Windows systems.

### API Configuration
```powershell
# Edit your API keys in the config file (this file is not tracked by Git)
notepad config.yaml

# Also configure UFO settings
notepad UFO\config\config.yaml
```

**Important**: The `config.yaml` file contains your API keys and is automatically excluded from Git commits for security.

### Configuration
1. Copy the configuration template:
```powershell
copy UFO\ufo\config\config.yaml.template UFO\ufo\config\config.yaml
```

2. Add the OpenAI API key and configure personal settings:
```yaml
HOST_AGENT:
  API_TYPE: "openai"
  API_KEY: "your-openai-api-key"
  API_MODEL: "gpt-4o"
  
APP_AGENT:
  API_TYPE: "openai"
  API_KEY: "your-openai-api-key"
  API_MODEL: "gpt-4o"
```

### Launch CadentialAI
> **Note**: CadentialAI and the UFO framework rely on Windows-only
> packages (`pywinauto`, `pywin32`). Launching the assistant on
> non‑Windows systems will result in `ModuleNotFoundError` for
> `win32api`.
```powershell
# Start CadentialAI (it will automatically load UFO framework)
python cadential_ai.py

# Or run UFO directly
cd UFO
python -m ufo --task "personal_assistant"
```
